Mara 7.5:

Race hazard causing partial upload of media fixed. (Uploader briefly signalling 'idle' between uploads could be taken as completion on slow processor. Flag changed to 'alldone' to avoid ambiguity.) 

CK updated to 4.11.1 (4.9 also provided in case of any compatibility issues with existing sites - Just rename folders.) 

Media handing - .svg graphics file capability added. 

Added inclusion of js and css from the page head. 
 This can be turned off in siteini.php if necessary, it's the phjscss item in [site] 
 -If it's not needed, turning off will save a little on page load time and processor usage.
